## Previous students

I take pride in working with students from diverse backgrounds, creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and equal opportunities for everyone. In my academic experience, I have had the pleasure of mentoring a diverse group of students from more than 11 nationalities, including those identifying as transfeminine non-binary.

## Comments from Students and Collaborators


* "I would like to send a very special and warm thanks to my supervisor Dr.
Ambuj Varshney, who have spent countless hours working closely with me, and
teaching me the ways of systems research. He has through his effort helped wire me
to think analytically and critically about groundbreaking research problems. But
more importantly, he has always maintained faith in my progress, while motivating
me during my most difficult times. This is more than I could ever ask from a
supervisor. Further, through my many interactions with Ambuj, I have developed
the confidence to believe that I can achieve success in everything I decide to do with
pure dedication and hard work, and by having a high fault tolerance. For that,
I am deeply thankful. I am certain that this mentality will benefit me greatly
in all my future endeavors."

* "I would like to thank Ambuj
Varshney. Ambuj gave me the first idea to work with LoRa and LPWAN
but beside this, just talking with him put my perspective about research in
whole different level."
