### Backscatter Communication

#### Platform

1. [Design of an RFID-Based Battery-Free Programmable Sensing Platform](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4539485)  
IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 2008 

#### Ambient Backscatter
These works do not require dedicated carrier emitting devices. Instead, they use ambient signals that are already present in the environment to communicate, by reflecting or absorbing them.

#### Backscattering Commodity Protocols
These works look into synthesizing transmissions compaitable to commodity wireless standards at a very low-power consumption using backscatter mechanism.
