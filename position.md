# WEISER Group at National University of Singapore

We are a curiosity driven group of students, engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded systems and Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies (WEISER). We build real systems, and we often work at the intersection of the area of electronics, communication and computer science. Thus, we welcome students with background in computer science, electronics, communication, and related areas. We publish scientific results at leading  venues in the area (such as ACM MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys, HotNets, IPSN). We have also received several awards, grants from industry, and extensive media coverage in leading publications across the world. 

We are establishing a world-leading group in the area of embedded systems, wireless communications, and mobile computing. We are hiring ambitious students and researchers for the following positions:

## Open Positions (6 NOS)  

## Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Internet of Things Devices and Robots ([Jointly with NUS-NCS Research Lab](https://nus-ncs.nus.edu.sg/))


## Doctoral Disseration (PhD Studies) (Positions open in this round: 3 NOS)

Following are examples of projects that can be pursued for doctoral studies:

### P1: Enabling Low-power communication for Internet of Things

Over the decades, hundreds of millions of internet of things devices have been deployed. Within our lifetime, this number is expected to reach a trillion. A challenge to this rapid growth in device numbers is their energy consumption. Batteries play a crucial role in IoT devices since they are highly power-intensive. Most IoT devices today require battery replacement several times during their lifetime. This can be challenging due to IoT devices being deployed at enormous scale, often located in hard-to-reach places.  Energy-intensive wireless transceivers are the primary reason for the high power consumption of IoT devices.

Using tunnel diodes and backscatter mechanisms, we have developed very low-power transmitters for tackling the energy challenge. This  project goes beyond our previous efforts. To enhance the reliability of transmissions and receptions, we would look to use various spreading and coding mechanisms. Another pertinent issue we aim to address is reception. Low-power receivers today have limited capabilities, and they must catch up with low-power transmitters. In this project, we aim to go beyond current low-power receivers (envelope detectors).  Our goal is to design transceivers that can transmit and receive hundreds of meters at a few hundred kilobits while consuming less than 100 microwatts. Comparing this to commercial transceivers, this would be an order of magnitude improvement. With this project, IoT devices are capable of lasting their entire lives without replacing batteries, or operating without batteries from energy harvested from the environment.

### P2: Hyperscale sensing via low-power, computation-less IoT platforms

Millions of internet of things devices have been deployed over the past decades. A challenge to this rapid growth is IoT devices' energy consumption. Most IoT devices today are power-consuming and require battery replacement several times during their lifetime. They are often located in hard-to-reach places, making this challenging task. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the power consumption of IoT devices so that they can operate for long periods without requiring a change of batteries or even enable them to operate on energy harvested from environment (such as light through a solar cell).

As part of our earlier research, we have explored alternative IoT device architectures that eliminate computational units to tackle the energy challenge of IoT devices. In this architecture, sensors are directly coupled to a low-power backscatter radio or tunnel diode transmitter (bypassing microcontrollers), thus enabling sensing and communication at microwatts of power. In this project, we build on these promising early results and aim to design sensors that perform very little or no computation. Instead, most of the processing tasks are delegated to edge devices. As part of this project, we will design a generic sensor platform. The next step is to explore how these sensors interact with edge devices and design associated infrastructure on edge devices. Finally, we would investigate scaling and supporting large numbers of these sensors and edge devices. These sensors could last a decade on a coin cell battery or only operate on harvested energy from the environment. We are looking for students with experience in embedded systems and wireless communication. 

You can learn more about this project through some of our earlier publications.
