# STICORS: Framework for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving, long-range wireless, sticker-form, everlasting computers
![Sticker form factor sensor](abbflexsensor.jpeg)  
We illustrate a proof-of-concept, sticker form factor, wireless sensor that can through reflection and absorption of ambient wireless signals achieve very significant transmission range

## Policy for Intellectual Property

We are committed to open publication and open-source release of software and hardware designs using a BSD-style license. We will not seek IP protection for research results unless there is an overwhelmingly compelling case that IP protection is essential for the results to have an impact.

## Publications

STICORS is an ongoing research project at the National University of Singapore. Our sincere gratitude goes out to former collaborators and students of the PI (Ambuj Varshney) at many of the world's foremost institutions for their contributions to this effort. In addition, they have contributed to several peer-reviewed scientific publications that have appeared at several flagship scientific venues. We list these research efforts below:
