## Assignment (Getting started with ContikiOS and SensorTag)

**Total Marks: 15 (3% weightage for CS4222/CS5422)**
 
This is an **INDIVIDUAL** assignment. 


### Overview

In  this  hands-on  assignment,  you  will  learn  how  to  setup  your  computer  system  to  be  able  to  compile and run program on your TI SensorTag CC2650. The latter is a programmable device with  10 sensors, including light, digital  microphone,  accelerometer,  gyroscope,  magnetometer,  object  temperature, and ambient temperature. Wireless networking support is provided with both ZigBee and BLE for Internet of Things applications. 

The OS to be used is [Contiki](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng). Contiki is an open source  operating  system, initially developed by [Adam  Dunkels](http://dunkels.com/adam/). Now, Contiki is  supported  by  a  large  community  of  developers.  Apart  from  for  supporting  both  IPv4 
and IPv6, it also includes multiple low-power wireless standards. Moreover, it runs on multiple  low-power devices, where the SensorTag is one of them.
