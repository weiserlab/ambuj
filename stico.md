# STICORS: Framework for Large-Scale, Ubiquitous, Privacy-Preserving, Flexible Form-Factor, Everlasting Computers with a Very Long-Range Wireless Capability
![flexible form factor sensor](abbflexsensor.jpeg)  
We illustrate a proof-of-concept, flexible-form, wireless computer that can through reflection and absorption of ambient wireless signals (building on LoRea (ACM SENSYS 2017)) achieve significant transmission range.

## Project PI: Prof. Dr. Ambuj Varshney 

## Vision

The goal of this project is to develop a framework to manage large-scale deployments of flexible computers (STICORS) that are packed with sensors, processors, energy storage, and human-computer interaction mechanisms, and that can connect wirelessly over long distances. These computers will be able to handle a range of advanced computing and communication tasks. This framework has the potential to support a wide range of applications, but currently, we are focusing on a platform for near real-time analytics on massive amounts of data collected from the physical world using STICORS computers.

STICORS is a research project that requires expertise in multiple engineering fields, including electronics, communication, computer science, and materials science. At present, the goals of the STICORS project are not yet attainable and will require significant scientific advances, which are the focus of the project.

We are targetting following parameters for STICORS computers:

* **Bitrate:** 
* **Range:** Greater than 100 meters of transmission and reception range in line-of-sight environment. Range of tens of meters in non line-of-sight environment (including through the wall)  
* **Everlasting:** Batteries can last entire lifetime of the deployment, requiring no additional effort to replace exhausted batteries. For some applications, STICORS may even support operation without batteries. In this case, STICORS will harvest energy from the ambient environment

## Policy for Intellectual Property

STICORS can significantly impact multiple application domains, bringing substantial value to society. We are committed to open publication and open-source release of software and hardware designs using a BSD-style license. The research results will only be protected if it is overwhelmingly clear that IP protection is crucial to their impact. Rather than protecting our backs with patents, we believe in running faster. Furthermore, society invests significant resources into us in academia, and we have an obligation to give back to the society without creating unnecessary obstacles as an example by brickwalling scientific breakthroughs under patents.
