# WEISER Group at National University of Singapore

We are a curiosity driven group of students, engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded systems and Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies (WEISER). We build real systems, and we often work at the intersection of the area of electronics, communication and computer science. Thus, we welcome students with background in computer science, electronics, communication, and related areas. We publish scientific results at leading  venues in the area (such as ACM MobiSys, ACM MobiCom, ACM SenSys, ACM HotNets, ACM/IEEE IPSN). We are well funded, connected to other leading groups and companies across the world. We have received several awards, grants from industry, and extensive media coverage in leading publications across the world. 

We are establishing a world-leading group in the area of embedded systems, wireless communications, and mobile computing. We are hiring ambitious students and researchers for the following positions:

**Skills required:** Embedded systems (such as programming microcontrollers, FPGAs), working with sensors and actuators, wireless communication (such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee) , previous experience with robot systems (such as ROS operating systems), embedded systems platforms (such as Raspberry Pi or Arduinos), machine learning frameworks (such as PyTorch, Tensorflow), and most importantly curiosity.

**Note:** These skills are not necessary, it is desirable if you have one or more of these skills. Most importantly, you should be curious, with desire to conduct experiments and learn. We will train you during the project.

## Open Positions (6 NOS)  

## P1: Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Internet of Things Devices and Robots   
([Jointly with NUS-NCS Research Lab](https://nus-ncs.nus.edu.sg/))

We have millions of internet of things (IoT) devices. Their numbers is to reach a trillion within our lifetime. The deployment of robots is also snowballing. Sensors, actuators, and wireless communication capabilities are built into them. Currently, these devices are ubiquitous in the environment, collecting private and sensitive information without external supervision. Due to their ability to move around, act on their surroundings, and collect sensitive data that may be unavailable to sensors, the threat is heightened with robots.

Our multi-year project aims to design a framework that combines sensors, edge devices, and cloud processing algorithms to mitigate some of these risks. Using this system, users would be able to monitor IoT devices and robots in a very non-intrusive way and be notified of potential threats and deviant behaviour. Specifically, we focus on two use cases; robots in elderly care and healthcare settings and wireless security cameras. 

**Available positions:** 1X Research Assistant (2X Years), and 1X Research Scientist (2X Years)

## Doctoral Disseration (PhD Studies) (Positions open in this round: 3 NOS)

Our research group is pursuing two major directions; STICORS and Beyond RF.

[**STICORS:**](https://weiserlab.github.io/ambuj/stico) We are starting a multi-year ambitious project to develop a framework for general purpose, flexible form factor, and ever-lasting computers. These computers will go beyond classic sensor platforms and are not restricted to the sense-and-transmit regime of the past decade of WSNs. Instead, these computers sense the physical world, actuate the environment, interact with users, process, store and infer information, and transmit wirelessly to considerable distances, building on our previous systems such as LoRea (ACM SENSYS 2017) and Judo (ACM MOBISYS 2022). 

**BEYOND RF:** This research direction looks to develop alternative to conventional and widely used methods of wireless communication for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Motiviation of this direction is due to growing scale of IoT devices and their energy challenge due to significant power consumption of existing radio technology.


Following are examples of projects that can be pursued for doctoral studies:

### P1: Enabling Low-power communication for Internet of Things

Over the decades, hundreds of millions of internet of things devices have been deployed. Within our lifetime, this number is expected to reach a trillion. A challenge to this rapid growth in device numbers is their energy consumption. Batteries play a crucial role in IoT devices since they are highly power-intensive. Most IoT devices today require battery replacement several times during their lifetime. This can be challenging due to IoT devices being deployed at enormous scale, often located in hard-to-reach places.  Energy-intensive wireless transceivers are the primary reason for the high power consumption of IoT devices.

Using tunnel diodes and backscatter mechanisms, we have developed very low-power transmitters for tackling the energy challenge. This  project goes beyond our previous efforts. To enhance the reliability of transmissions and receptions, we would look to use various spreading and coding mechanisms. Another pertinent issue we aim to address is reception. Low-power receivers today have limited capabilities, and they must catch up with low-power transmitters. In this project, we aim to go beyond current low-power receivers (envelope detectors).  Our goal is to design transceivers that can transmit and receive hundreds of meters at a few hundred kilobits while consuming less than 100 microwatts. Comparing this to commercial transceivers, this would be an order of magnitude improvement. With this project, IoT devices are capable of lasting their entire lives without replacing batteries, or operating without batteries from energy harvested from the environment.

### P2: Hyperscale sensing via low-power, computation-less IoT platforms

Millions of internet of things devices have been deployed over the past decades. A challenge to this rapid growth is IoT devices' energy consumption. Most IoT devices today are power-consuming and require battery replacement several times during their lifetime. They are often located in hard-to-reach places, making this challenging task. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the power consumption of IoT devices so that they can operate for long periods without requiring a change of batteries or even enable them to operate on energy harvested from environment (such as light through a solar cell).

As part of our earlier research, we have explored alternative IoT device architectures that eliminate computational units to tackle the energy challenge of IoT devices. In this architecture, sensors are directly coupled to a low-power backscatter radio or tunnel diode transmitter (bypassing microcontrollers), thus enabling sensing and communication at microwatts of power. In this project, we build on these promising early results and aim to design sensors that perform very little or no computation. Instead, most of the processing tasks are delegated to edge devices. As part of this project, we will design a generic sensor platform. The next step is to explore how these sensors interact with edge devices and design associated infrastructure on edge devices. Finally, we would investigate scaling and supporting large numbers of these sensors and edge devices. These sensors could last a decade on a coin cell battery or only operate on harvested energy from the environment. We are looking for students with experience in embedded systems and wireless communication. 

You can learn more about this project through some of our earlier publications.

**Skills required:**

 
### P3: Enabling system support for everlasting internet of things


### P4: Going beyond smartdust with sticker form factor computers


We are looking for ambitious students with good engineering backgrounds. Prior experience in embedded systems, programming, machine learning, wireless and computer networking, PCB and electronics design is beneficial, but not necessary. We are willing to work with anyone who is interested  and willing to learn.
