# PROMPTS FOR CHATGPT

## OVERVIEW
Large language models (LLMs) like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) are trained on vast amounts of data, making them proficient in conversation and providing feedback. Despite a somewhat unsuccessful history, chatbots are finally reaching a point where they can be highly beneficial for learning. ChatGPT, for example, can be used to gain knowledge about wireless technology. We encourage the use of this tool for educational purposes in our course.

We encourage you to interact with ChatGPT by providing it with prompts related to wireless networking and technologies, and to engage in conversation with the bot in order to expand your knowledge on the subject.   

Below, you will find a list of sample prompts. If you have suggestions for good prompt, please email them to the instructor. We may consider this for bonus marks/points.

## Lecture 1

* Can you describe the early history of wireless communication?
* What is photophone and history of this device?
* What is early history of FM modulation technique?
* Describe some examples of everyday internet of things devices that we use
* What are challenges to massive growth of internet of things
* What is smartdust?
* Can you give examples of different sensors used in IoT devices?

## Lecture 2

* What is Friis equation in wireless communication ?
* What is antenna gain? How is it related to Friis equation?
* What are typical antenna gain values for commonly used antenna?
* Does antenna gain value varies with frequency?
* Does radio propagation  has a circular disk model?
* How does wireless interference impact signal propogation?
* What is path loss exponent?
* How do atmosphere absorb radio signals and at what frequencies?
* what are commonly used wireless standards and can you classify them basis of throughput, range, frequency and datarate?
* Can you describe shannon capacity and the parameters that it depends upon?
* What is a microcontroller and how does it differ from microprocessor?
* What is a system on chip?
* How does system on chip differ from microcontroller?
* What is early history of microprocessor?
* what is early history of microcontroller?
* what is early history of system-on-chip?
* Why do we need seperate operating system for small IoT and embedded devices?
* What are examples of IoT operating system?

## Lecture 3

* What are attenuation and gain? What are common units to represent them for wireless signals?
* How do you calculate attenuation in dB?
* Why is loss of 3 dB strength in wireless signals important?
* Can you add two decibel terms together?
* How do you represent signal strength in milliwatts (in logarithmic scale)?
* What are actuators? and can you list ten commonly used actuators on IoT devices?
* How does LED work? how are RGB leds different from normal LEDs?


## POLICY REGARDING USING AI TOOLS

We are experiencing a major shift in the computing landscape with the emergence of advanced tools such as Language Language Models (LLMs) such as [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). These tools are poised to have a significant impact on the field, and we are embracing this change by incorporating them into our course curriculum. The CS4222/5222 course will be one of the first (if not the first) course in the world at a major univeristy to actively use OpenAI's ChatGPT in teaching wireless technology. Students will be provided with "prompts" to work with the model and we may also propose projects for more ambitious students to utilize ChatGPT. However, we will not be using ChatGPT for tutorials in this iteration of the course. It is important for students who utilize ChatGPT to clearly indicate that they have employed the tool.

**IMPORTANT:** It is important to note that Large Language Models (LLMs) are still in the early stages of development and may not always produce accurate results. Therefore, these tools should only be used as a supplement, not as the primary source of information, and one should use them with caution.
