Among the various tasks performed by IoT devices, wireless networking is one of the most critical tasks. This particular task has also dictated most of the research effort within the over the past two decades. This course will cover a broad spectrum of topics related to wireless communication, sensing and the networking aspect of IoT devices. The topics we intend to cover during the semester includes; Fundamentals of the internet of things, commonly employed wireless standards, energy challenge of IoT devices, sustainability and recent thrust towards battery-free operations, and emerging transmission mechanisms backscatter communication and visible light communication (LiFi).
