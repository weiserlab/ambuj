## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="http://ambuj.se/ambuj_files/photo3.jpg">

I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Computing of the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg). I am bootstrapping WEISER group.

WEISER group consists of a curiosity driven group of students, engineers and researchers interested in **W**ireless, **E**mbedded systems and **I**ntelligence, **S**ensing and **E**me**r**ging Technologies (WEISER). We build real systems. We commonly work at the intersection of the area of electronics, communication and computer science.

### Contact details

I am located at the new [computer science building Computing 3(COM3)](https://com3.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My office address is: #02-25, Computing 3, School of Computing, 11 Research Link, Singapore 119391. For scheduling and other general queries, you may email my personal assistant:  [Joy](mailto:joy@nus.edu.sg)

## Research Interest
> “Applications are of course the whole point of ubiquitous computing” - [Mark Weiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weiser)  

> “In the future, increasing proportion of computer science research will be application-driven” -
[Eric Brewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Brewer_(scientist)) and [Mike Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Franklin)    

> “Your willingness to fail is what will let you succeed” - [Vinod Khosla, Founder, Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla)     

We are interested in **wireless**, **networking**, and **embedded systems**, and their intersection with other domains.  We often combine elements from electronics, communications, and computer science.  As a group, we are not into "bean-counting". We work on meaningful problems with complex engineering component, and potential for real-world impact.    

Often, our projects involves collaborations with domain experts. A number of our projects are done in collaboration with leading companies in the area.

## Research Themes

Before I became an academic, I was a software engineer at [NXP Semiconductors](http://nxp.com). Thus, I am an engineer and an experimental computer scientist.  The majority of the projects that I work on are application-driven. Generally, they fall under one of these themes.  

* **Bridging digital world with physical world:**  

* **Data collection (and analysis) from the physical world**    

### Applications 

* **Factories of the future:**  

* **Climate change:**   

## Individual Projects  

* **Sticker form-factor computers**  

* **Wireless Transmitters:**    

* **Low-power Sensing:**  

* **Visible Light Communication (LiFI):**
