# TUTORIAL 1 for WEEK3 (Starting 23rd of January 2023)

## All the students should come prepared with ideas, solutions, and suggestions to participate in the group discussion.

* Q1: What are the ISM  bands used for wireless communication? In residential and NUS campus settings, which frequency bands support WiFi communication? Finally, do TV and FM radio transmissions occur on ISMÃŸ bands?

* Q2: Please elaborate on the relationship between power consumption, data rate, and range in various wireless standards. If tasked with designing the following applications, what range and frequency of operation would you target? How would these choices impact the data rate ?

| Application | Description|
|-------|--------|
| Temperature sensor| This device allows measuring temperature inside the house. The sensor (temperature) readings are then  wirelessly transmitted to a smartphone | 
| Soil sensor | This system measures the humidity levels and quality of soil on farms, transmitting this information to a central basestation located at the farm's center| 
| IoT camera | Deployed in urban areas, this system captures images and short videos for surveillance purposes. The gathered information is wirelessly transmitted to the cloud for anomaly detection and processing |
