In addition, wireless networking is supported through Zigbee and BLE standards. The operating system used is [Contiki](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng), an open-source system created by [Adam  Dunkels](http://dunkels.com/adam/) and now supported by a large developer community. Contiki supports multiple low-power wireless standards on various low-power platforms, including the SensorTag.
