# WEISER Group at National University of Singapore

We are a curiosity driven group of students, engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded systems and Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies (WEISER). We build real systems, and we commonly work at the intersection of the area of electronics, communication and computer science.  In addition to publishing scientific results at leading  venues in the area (such as ACM MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys, HotNets, IPSN), we have received several research awards, industry grants, and media coverage in leading publications across the world. 

We aim to establish a world-leading group in embedded systems, wireless communications, and mobile computing. Our group is looking to expand, so we are looking to hire ambitious students for the following positions:


Research Associate/Assistant: These positions are for students who have completed bachelors or masters degree. These are paid positions wit

Research Interns:

Resarch Scientist:


## Open Positions (6 NOS)  

## Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Internet of Things Devices and Robots


## Low-power Vibration Monitoring


## Doctoral Disseration (PhD Studies) (Positions open in this round: 3 NOS)

### P1: Low-power communication for Internet of Things

Over the past decade, hundreds of millions of internet of things devices have been deployed. Within our lifetime, this number is expected to reach a trillion. A challenge to this rapid growth in device numbers is their energy consumption. Batteries play a crucial role in IoT devices since they are highly power-intensive. Most IoT devices today require battery replacement several times during their lifetime. This can be challenging due to IoT devices being deployed at enormous scale, often located in hard-to-reach places.  Energy-intensive wireless transceivers are the primary reason for the high power consumption of IoT devices.

Using tunnel diodes and backscatter mechanisms, we have developed very low-power transmitters for tackling the energy challenge. This  project goes beyond our previous efforts. To enhance the reliability of transmissions and receptions, we would look to use various spreading and coding mechanisms. Another pertinent issue we aim to address is reception. Low-power receivers today have limited capabilities, and they must catch up with low-power transmitters. In this project, we aim to go beyond current low-power receivers (envelope detectors).  Our goal is to design transceivers that can transmit and receive hundreds of meters at a few hundred kilobits while consuming less than 100 microwatts. Comparing this to commercial transceivers, this would be an order of magnitude improvement. With this project, IoT devices are capable of lasting their entire lives without replacing batteries, or operating without batteries from energy harvested from the environment.
