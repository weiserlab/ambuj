## OVERVIEW  
This course offers a introduction to the field of wireless networking and the rapidly expanding world of the Internet of Things (IoT). It covers various layers of wireless networking, including physical, link, MAC, routing, and application, and discusses relevant wireless standards such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, cellular networks for IoT (NB-IOT), and long-range standards such as LoRa. In addition, the course explores emerging technologies like LiFi (visible light communication) and backscatter. The course also focuses on the energy efficiency of IoT devices and the integration of sensing, communication, and processing. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply these concepts through hands-on projects that involve creating software prototypes on real IoT devices.
