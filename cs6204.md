## OVERVIEW  

Internet of things (IoT) is an integral part of our lives with millions of IoT devices deployed worldwide, and projected to reach a trillion within our lifetime.  

This course covers the basics of IoT systems and some of the emerging applications. A major focus of this course is on wireless networking, one of the most critical functions of an IoT device. This course covers various topics such as,  device architecture, basics of wireless communication and standards, emerging wireless standards, sensing and actuation, and power management. Other topics related to IoT are also discussed in invited lectures (by leading academic researchers and leaders from industry) as well as student driven seminars.  

## PREREQUISITES  

We expect this course will be most beneficial to students with a background in embedded systems, mobile computing, networking, sensing, and wireless communication. Regardless of your background, as long as you are willing to learn, you can participate and benefit from taking the course.  

## READINGS

This course is based on research papers related to IoT that are seminal to the area, or have appeared recently at leading venues for research related to IoT and mobile systems  such as ACM MobiCom, MobiSys, Sigcomm, NSDI, SenSys, IMWUT. Therefore, there is no recommended textbook for the course.

### Invited Speaker 1: Dr. Mobashir Mohammad (NUS/SoC Alumni)

**Abstract** 

With the infrastructure projects becoming increasingly complex there is an imminent need for stringent and real-time monitoring of various parameters. From geotechnical instruments to machines like TBM. From environment data to tracking people. There are highly sophisticated sensors available at our disposal to track the minutest of activities on any project. Analyzing those not only makes infrastructures safe but also identifies bottlenecks for increased efficiency. Despite using wireless communication every single day of our lives, it remains the biggest challenge to use on mega-scale infrastructure projects and yet is the key technology that can help it. In this talk, we'd discuss how infrastructure monitoring has evolved with the introduction of the latest wireless standards and what the future holds.

### Invited Speaker 2: Prof. Dr. Akshay Gadre

**Title: Rethinking Low-Power Wide-Area Networks on Earth and Space**

**Abstract**   
Internet-of-Things (IoT) has widely permeated our daily lives and is used for various applications ranging from agriculture to industrial IoT. Yet, IoT deployments are inherently asymmetric where more resourceful base stations and cloud infrastructure lie on the other side of a IoT clients' bandwidth starved link. This precludes the possibility of data-driven applications on IoT deployments for large scale sensing such as smart agriculture, automated traffic signals and micro-climate monitoring. While some smart-home sensors can communicate large amounts of data to enable low-latency complex inference applications, the big data revolution has eluded low-power IoT sensors from realizing their true potential.

In this talk, I will show how we can overcome these fundamental limitations of IoT wireless technologies and build systems that enable such data driven applications at scale. First, I will show how we can reduce the latency for large-scale inference queries (from several hours to a few milliseconds) by designing a new approach for clients to work together for overcoming the bandwidth-bottlenecks of individual wireless links. Next, I will talk about how we can push the wireless and compute operations from these low-power IoT clients to the much more powerful base stations to improve client throughput and battery life. Finally, I will showcase how we can leverage a similar approach for improving the capabilities of small satellites (called CubeSats) operating in low-earth orbit. I will conclude my talk with a discussion about how IoT will transform new domains in the coming years and how my research will attempt to address the challenges in these areas.

### Invited Speaker 3: Prof. Dr. Nirupam Roy

**Title: Ultra-low-power Acoustic Perception in IoT**

**Abstract**   
Agile and miniature robots are emerging with new capabilities and sensing skills. Insect-sized robots are becoming new first responders to search for survivors in disaster debris. Tiny drones, each a couple of inches in size, are helping mapping a hazardous location before deploying human rescuers. These small robotic systems, when paired with autonomous navigation, can create new possibilities in a wide range of crucial applications, including precision farming, disaster management, and surveillance and monitoring. However, it will require overcoming a set of challenges to realize the vision and perception of the environment probably the most crucial of them. It is, however, challenging for small robotic systems due to the unique constraints of limited energy source, low weight carrying capacity and size, small computational power, and the requirement of low-cost manufacturing (SWaP-C constraints). This talk presents recent works in ultra-low-power acoustic sensing and perception as an opportunity to bridge this gap.

**Biography**
