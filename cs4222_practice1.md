# TUTORIAL 9 (Optional) for WEEK 13 (Starting 3rd April 2023)
## This is a non-graded tutorial. We provide some sample questions to help you prepare for end-term examination.


[1] **Question 1:** You are developing an application to deploy IoT devices in urban areas to help monitor air quality. These IoT devices measure air pollution levels and transmit the information to a base station located in the city. The base stations are located several kilometers away from the IoT devices. In this deployment, you plan to use LoRa for communication. You can assume that there is no synchronization among  various devices and  base station.

* What are the available frequency bands for IoT device? (1 point)
* Assuming each sensor requires 125 KHz of bandwidth for communication and that there is a total of 20 MHz bandwidth available for uplink communication, calculate the number of devices that can concurrently transmit to the base station when employing FSK and when employing LoRa with CSS. Please justify your answer and mention any assumptions made while performing this calculation. (2 points)
* What are the advantages of using the LoRa protocol over other long-range standards such as FSK/SigFox? (1 point)
* Which medium access control mechanism would you prefer for this deployment, and what is the rationale behind your choice? (1 point)
* Given that we use the highest sensitivity mode of the LoRa receiver at the base station (-146 dBm), and both the air quality sensor and base station are equipped with antennas with a gain of 2 dB, and the distance between them is 4 kilometers, what is the minimum transmitter strength required to ensure successful reception at the base station? (4 points)

[2] **Question 2:** Ipv6 protocol enables a very large scale deployment of IoT devices. If you are deploying IoT devices that are using IPv6 protocol at the network layer. Please answer the following questions:

* What is the advantage of using IPv6 over IPv4 in Internet of Things? How many address does IPv4 support?   (2 points)
* What are the various header and address compression mechanisms that are employed in IPv6 protocol ?   (2 point)
* Please expand the following Ipv6 address into full form: aecb:222::10 ? (2 point)

[3] **Question 3:**  Bluetooth is one of the most widely used protocols in Internet of Things. You are deploying an IoT network that uses bluetooth standard. Please answer the following questions:

* If you are using Bluetooth standard 4.2, with PHY data rate of 1 Megabit/second. How long (in millisecond) does it take to transmit one bluetooth advertisement packet? If you instead use BLE 5.2 standard? (1 point)

* If a bluetooth transmitter consumes 10 milliwatts. How much energy is spent for transmitting one cycle of advertisement? (2 point)

* Would you like to stream audio data over connection oriented or  advertising mode? Why? (1 point)

* The latest variant of bleuetooth standard supports extended advertisements. What are the bluetooth channels that are used to support this mode? (2 points)
