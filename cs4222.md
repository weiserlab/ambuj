## OVERVIEW  
This course offers a introduction to the field of wireless networking and the rapidly expanding world of the Internet of Things (IoT). It covers various layers of wireless networking, including physical, link, MAC, routing, and application, and discusses relevant wireless standards such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, cellular networks for IoT (NB-IOT), and long-range standards such as LoRa. In addition, the course explores emerging technologies like LiFi (visible light communication) and backscatter. The course also focuses on the energy efficiency of IoT devices and the integration of sensing, communication, and processing. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to apply these concepts through hands-on projects that involve creating software prototypes on real IoT devices.

## PROJECTS

We will use the following platform for conducting projects in the course:

* [Texas Instruments CC2650: Sensor Tag](https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDC-CC2650STK-SENSORTAG) 

We also have limited quantities of following platform for ambitious group of students:

* [Nicla Sense ME](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-sense-me) (Available for 12 groups of students)

* [Nicla Vision](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-vision) (Available for 12 groups of students)

* [Texas Instruments CC1350: Multi Protocol Development Kit](https://www.ti.com/tool/CC1350STK) (Available for 20 groups of students)

Other details about the project would be announced in due course.

## COMMUNICATION
The course has its own dedicated Slack page, which serves as a platform for communication among the instructor, teaching assistants, and students. Additionally, students are encouraged to share news and articles pertaining to the topics of IoT and wireless within the Slack workspace.

## GRADING

The assessment of this course will be conducted as follows:

* Continuous assesment/assignment (70% of the grades)
* Final assesment, open book (30% of the grades)

## POLICY REGARDING USING AI TOOLS

We are experiencing a major shift in the computing landscape with the emergence of advanced tools such as Language Language Models (LLMs) such as [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). These tools are poised to have a significant impact on the field, and we are embracing this change by incorporating them into our course curriculum. The CS4222/5222 course will be one of the first (if not the first) course in the world at a major univeristy to actively use OpenAI's ChatGPT in teaching wireless technology. Students will be provided with "prompts" to work with the model and we may also propose projects for more ambitious students to utilize ChatGPT. However, we will not be using ChatGPT for tutorials in this iteration of the course. It is important for students who utilize ChatGPT to clearly indicate that they have employed the tool.

**IMPORTANT:** It is important to note that Large Language Models (LLMs) are still in the early stages of development and may not always produce accurate results. Therefore, these tools should only be used as a supplement, not as the primary source of information, and one should use them with caution.
