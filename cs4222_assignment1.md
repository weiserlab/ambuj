# ASSIGNMENT 1 (Due, Tutorial #3, Week 5)


## Assignment (Getting started with ContikiOS and SensorTag)

**Total Marks: 15 (3% weightage for CS4222/CS5422)**
 
This is an **INDIVIDUAL** assignment. 


### Overview

This hands-on assignment introduces you to TI SensorTag CC2650, a programmable device with ten sensors, such as light, digital microphone, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and temperature. In addition, wireless networking is supported through Zigbee and BLE standards. The operating system used is [Contiki](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng), an open-source system created by [Adam  Dunkels](http://dunkels.com/adam/) and now supported by a large developer community. Contiki supports multiple low-power wireless standards on various low-power platforms, including the SensorTag.

### Setting up environment

Please read the following guides, written for these operating systems:

* [Windows](https://ambuj.se/instructions_cc2650.pdf)
* [Mac OS/Linux](https://ambuj.se/linux_mac.pdf) [Please ignore dates mentioned in the PDF]


### Assignment

During the tutorial periods in Week 4 (Jan 30th) or Week 5 (Feb 6th), you need to demonstrate to the  Lecturer, or one of the TAs that you have successfully installed the CC2650 development tool on your personal laptop (or LattePanda) by running the “Hello-World” program. 
 
**Important:** In your demonstration, you should change the output to print your “Name” instead of  the string “Hello World”. Furthermore, you should also blink one of the onboard LED (actuator) on the sensor tag platform.

If you are unable to complete the demonstration during the tutorials, you can email the Lecturer, or one of the TAs for an appointment. 
 
Grading/demonstrate should be completed by Feb 10, 2023.  
 
Late penalty is 10% per day after Feb 10, 2023.
