# TUTORIAL 4 (Starting 6th of February 2023)


[1] **Question 1:** What is the typical battery capacity of common devices that you use in your daily life such as wearables (Apple Watch/Fitbit), earphones, laptops, and mobile phones?

[2] **Question 2:**
* In the figure represting state transition diagtam, which chipset is more suitable for used in Internet of Things applications? Explain your reasoning.

* For the chipset chosen in the question above, assume that the devices are designed to operate at a very low duty-cycle (<0.01%) and you are allowed to reduce the current drawn from only one of the states (idle, receive (RX) or transmit (TX)). Which state would you reduce the current from?
