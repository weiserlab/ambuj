# Stico: Towards ubiqutious, privacy-preserving, sticker form-factor, and everlasting wireless computers
![Sticker form factor sensor](abbflexsensor.jpeg)  
We illustrate a proof-of-concept, sticker form factor, wireless sensor that can through reflection and absorption of ambient wireless signals achieve very significant transmission range
