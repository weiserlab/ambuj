# PROMPTS FOR CHATGPT

## OVERVIEW
Large language models (LLMs) like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) are trained on vast amounts of data, making them proficient in conversation and providing feedback. Despite a somewhat unsuccessful history, chatbots are finally reaching a point where they can be highly beneficial for learning. ChatGPT, for example, can be used to gain knowledge about wireless technology. We encourage the use of this tool for educational purposes in our course.

We encourage you to interact with ChatGPT by providing it with prompts related to wireless networking and technologies, and to engage in conversation with the bot in order to expand your knowledge on the subject.   

Below, you will find a list of sample prompts. **If you have suggestions for good prompt, please email them to the instructor. We may consider this for bonus marks/points.**

## Lecture 8:

### Why is local discovery useful for wireless networks?
**Answer:** Local discovery is essential for wireless networks because it enables devices to find and communicate with each other within a given area. This process is critical for establishing connections, sharing resources, and exchanging information between devices. Specifically, local discovery:

Facilitates efficient resource allocation: Local discovery allows devices to identify nearby network nodes, enabling the most efficient use of available resources such as bandwidth and power.

* Enables ad-hoc networks: Local discovery allows devices to dynamically form ad-hoc networks, which can be useful in situations where a central infrastructure is unavailable or impractical.
* Enhances network security: By discovering local devices, network administrators can monitor network activity and identify potentially malicious nodes or security threats.
* Simplifies network setup and maintenance: Local discovery can help automate the process of setting up and maintaining network configurations, which can be especially useful for large, complex wireless networks.

### What is synchronous and asynchronous neighbour discovery? What is the difference between the two?
**Answer:** Synchronous and asynchronous neighbour discovery are two methods used by wireless devices to detect and establish connections with nearby devices in a network. The main difference between the two lies in their timing and coordination mechanisms.

* Synchronous neighbour discovery: In this method, devices follow a predefined schedule to send and listen for discovery messages. This requires accurate time synchronization among all devices in the network. The advantage of synchronous discovery is that it can be more energy-efficient, as devices know exactly when to listen for messages and can power down their radios during other periods.

* Asynchronous neighbour discovery: In this method, devices do not rely on a common schedule or time synchronization. Instead, they send and listen for discovery messages independently and at random intervals. Asynchronous discovery is more robust and can work in networks with unreliable or no time synchronization, but it can be less energy-efficient due to the increased likelihood of devices listening for messages when none are being sent.

### What is power save mode in wireless communication in mobile devices?
**Answer:** Power save mode is a feature in wireless communication systems, particularly in mobile devices, designed to conserve energy by minimizing the device's radio usage. This is achieved by:

* Reducing transmission power: The device may lower its transmission power when communicating with nearby devices, as less energy is needed to maintain a strong signal.

* Periodic listening: The device may periodically switch its radio on and off to listen for incoming messages, rather than continuously listening. This allows the device to conserve energy during periods when no communication is taking place.

* Sleep intervals: The device may enter a low-power sleep mode during periods of inactivity, during which its radio and other components are powered down to conserve energy.

These measures help extend the battery life of mobile devices, making them more suitable for use in situations where access to a power source is limited or unavailable.


## POLICY REGARDING USING AI TOOLS

We are experiencing a major shift in the computing landscape with the emergence of advanced tools such as Language Language Models (LLMs) such as [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). These tools are poised to have a significant impact on the field, and we are embracing this change by incorporating them into our course curriculum. The CS4222/5222 course will be one of the first (if not the first) course in the world at a major univeristy to actively use OpenAI's ChatGPT in teaching wireless technology. Students will be provided with "prompts" to work with the model and we may also propose projects for more ambitious students to utilize ChatGPT. However, we will not be using ChatGPT for tutorials in this iteration of the course. It is important for students who utilize ChatGPT to clearly indicate that they have employed the tool.

**IMPORTANT:** It is important to note that Large Language Models (LLMs) are still in the early stages of development and may not always produce accurate results. Therefore, these tools should only be used as a supplement, not as the primary source of information, and one should use them with caution.
