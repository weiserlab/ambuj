# WEISER Group at National University of Singapore

We are a group of curious students, engineers, and researchers interested in wireless, embedded systems, intelligence, sensing, and emerging technologies in real world(WEISER).  We build **REAL** systems and frequently operate at the intersection of electronics, communication, and computer science. Hence, engineering systems is an important part of our groups activity and focus. We welcome students who have backgrounds in computer science, electronics, communication, and related fields. Our  group's scientific findings are consistently published at leading venues in our field, such as ACM MobiSys, ACM MobiCom, ACM SenSys, ACM HotNets, ACM HotMobile, and ACM/IEEE IPSN. Additionally, we are well-funded, connected to other prestigious groups at top universities (like UC Berkeley via Lab 11), and corporations worldwide (such as NCS, Huawei through ARTIC, and previously with ABB). We have received  awards and grants from the industry, complemented by extensive media coverage across the globe.

We are establishing a world-leading group in the areas of embedded systems, wireless communications, and mobile computing. We are seeking ambitious students and researchers for the following positions:

**Skills required:** We are looking for students and scholars with a strong engineering background, ideally with experience in one or more of the following areas:  

* Embedded systems (such as programming microcontrollers and FPGAs)
* Previous experience with interfacing sensors and actuators

## Open Positions (6+ NOS)  

## P1: Internet of Things and Large Language Models (LLMs)  
([Jointly with NUS-NCS Research Lab](https://nus-ncs.nus.edu.sg/))

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard have garnered substantial interest and seen significant advancements in their capabilities. We are keenly interested in constructing "Eyes and Ears" for LLMs by interfacing sensors and actuators with these models. Additionally, we aim to explore other facets of integrating LLMs with Internet of Things devices. We have already achieved some very promising results in this regard.

This initiative is a component of a larger project where we are developing a comprehensive framework that melds sensors, edge devices, and LLMs for non-intrusive monitoring of the robots and IoT devices.

## P2: Low-Power Wireless Sensing of Vital Signs using Tunnel Diodes
[Funded through ARTIC@CDE, NUS]()

Every day, we engage with wireless signals. WiFi, as an example, connects our electronic devices to the internet. However, the use of wireless signals extends beyond communication. These signals, reflected or refracted by large objects in the environment, can provide additional information. For instance, signals bounced off our bodies may reveal details about our heart rate and respiratory patterns.

Our recent advancements have allowed us to generate wireless signals with a power consumption that is 1000 times less than that of smartphones or WiFi routers. Our preliminary and quite promising results suggest that this could pave the way for innovative sensing methods. For instance, we've demonstrated its potential use in detecting gestures via hand movements (MOBICOM 2022, Poster). As part of this project, our aim is to expand upon these promising results, designing a highly efficient, low-power system for monitoring heart and respiration rates. When juxtaposed with existing systems, our solution promises to be significantly less complex and considerably more power-efficient.

### P3: Enabling Low-power communication for Internet of Things 

One of the important challenge to  rapid growth in IoT device numbers is their energy consumption. Batteries are an important part of the IoT devices. Most IoT devices today require battery replacement several times during their lifetime. This can be challenging due to IoT devices being deployed at enormous scale, and they are often located in hard-to-reach places. Among the different tasks performed by IoT device, communication is the most power consuming task. Thus, energy-intensive wireless transceivers are one of the primary reason for the high power consumption of IoT devices.

Using tunnel diode oscillators and backscatter mechanisms, we have developed very low-power transmitters for tackling the  challenge of energy expensive wireless transmission. In this project, we go beyond our previous efforts. To enhance the reliability of transmissions and receptions, we would look to use various spreading and coding mechanisms. Another pertinent issue we aim to address is the reception challenge. Low-power receivers today have limited capabilities, and they must catch up with the capabilities of low-power transmitters. In this project, we aim to go beyond current low-power receivers (envelope detectors).  Eventually, our goal is to design transceivers that can transmit and receive hundreds of meters at a few hundred kilobits while consuming less than 100 microwatts. Comparing this to commercial transceivers, this would be atleast an order of magnitude improvement. With this project, IoT devices would be capable of lasting their entire lives without replacing batteries, or even operating without batteries from energy harvested from the environment.

### P4: Hyperscale sensing via low-power, computation-less Internet of Things platforms 

Historically, communication has been considered the most power-consuming operation in IoT devices. Recently, some advances in designing low-power transmitters based on backscatter mechanisms (including some of our own) have overturned this notion. Computing becomes a more power-intensive task on IoT devices.

As part of our earlier research, we have explored alternative IoT device architectures that eliminate computational units to tackle the energy challenge of IoT devices. In this architecture, sensors are directly coupled to a low-power backscatter radio or tunnel diode transmitter (bypassing microcontrollers), thus enabling sensing and communication at microwatts of power. In this project, we build on these promising early results and aim to design sensors that perform very little or no computation. Instead, most of the processing tasks are delegated to edge devices. As part of this project, we will design a generic sensor platform. The next step is to explore how these sensors interact with edge devices and design associated infrastructure on edge devices. Finally, we would investigate scaling and supporting large numbers of these sensors and edge devices. These sensors could last a decade on a coin cell battery or only operate on harvested energy from the environment.
