# WEISER Group at National University of Singapore

We are a curiosity driven group of students, engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded systems and Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies (WEISER). We build real systems, and we often work at the intersection of the areas of electronics, communication and computer science. Thus, we welcome students with background in computer science, electronics, communication, and related areas. We publish scientific results at leading  venues in the area (such as ACM MobiSys, ACM MobiCom, ACM SenSys, ACM HotNets, ACM/IEEE IPSN). We are well funded, connected to other leading groups at major universities and companies across the world. We have received several awards, grants from industry, and extensive media coverage across the world. 

We are establishing a world-leading group in the area of embedded systems, wireless communications, and mobile computing. We are hiring ambitious students and researchers for the following positions:

**Skills required:** We are looking for students and scholars with a strong engineering background. With background in one or more of the following area: Embedded systems (such as programming microcontrollers, FPGAs), working with sensors and actuators, wireless communication (such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee) , previous experience with robot systems (such as ROS operating systems), embedded systems platforms (such as Raspberry Pi or Arduinos), PCB design and fabrication, 3D printing,  machine learning frameworks (such as PyTorch, Tensorflow), and most importantly curiosity.

**Note:** These skills are not necessary, it is only desirable if you have one or more of these skills. Most importantly, you should be curious, have desire to conduct experiments and learn. We will train you.


We are located at the Systems and Networking lab in the new [computer science building Computing 3(COM3)](https://com3.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

## Open Positions (6 to 8 NOS)  

## P1: Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Internet of Things Devices and Robots   
([Jointly with NUS-NCS Research Lab](https://nus-ncs.nus.edu.sg/))

We have millions of internet of things (IoT) devices. Their numbers is to reach a trillion within our lifetime. The deployment of robots is also snowballing. Sensors, actuators, and wireless communication capabilities are built into them. Currently, these devices are ubiquitous in the environment, collecting private and sensitive information without external supervision. Due to their ability to move around, act on their surroundings, and collect sensitive data that may be unavailable to sensors, the threat is heightened with robots.

Our multi-year project aims to design a framework that combines sensors, edge devices, and cloud processing algorithms to mitigate some of these risks. Using this system, users would be able to monitor IoT devices and robots in a very non-intrusive way and be notified of potential threats and deviant behaviour. Specifically, we focus on two use cases; robots in elderly care and healthcare settings and wireless security cameras. 

**Available positions:** 1X Research Assistant (2X Years), and 1X Research Scientist (2X Years)

## P2: Low-Power Wireless Sensing using Tunnel Diodes
We interact with wireless signals every day. WiFi, for example, allows us to connect our electronic devices to the internet. In addition to communication, wireless signals can also be used for other purposes. Signals can be reflected or refracted by macroscopic objects in the environment. Reflected signals from our body result in reflections that provide us with additional information about our bodies. For example, we may be able to learn information about our heartbeat and respiration rate when it reflects through our chest. 

Our breakthroughs made over the past few years have enabled us to generate wireless signals while consuming 1000X less power than smartphones or WiFI routers. Our early and very promising results show that this may enable novel method for sensing. For example, we demonstrated that it could be used to detect gestures via hand movements [(MOBICOM 2022, Poster)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3495243.3558281). As part of this project, we would like to build on our promising results, and design a very low complexity, low power, breath and heart rate monitoring system. When compared to existing systems, this system would consume considerably less power at singificantly lower complexity.

**Available positions:** 1X Research Assistant (1X Years), and 1X Research Scientist (1X Years)

## Doctoral Disseration (PhD Studies) (Positions open in this round: 3 NOS)

Our research group is pursuing two major directions; STICORS and Beyond RF.

[**STICORS:**](https://weiserlab.github.io/ambuj/stico): We are starting a multi-year ambitious project to develop a framework for general purpose, flexible form factor, and ever-lasting computers. Unlike classic sensor platforms, these computers go beyond the sense-and-transmit regime of the past decade. They sense the physical world, actuate the environment, interact with users, process, store, infer information, and transmit wirelessly. Based on our previous systems, such as LoRea (ACM SENSYS 2017) and Judo (ACM MOBISYS 2022), they can communicate over considerable distances. 

[**BEYOND RF:**](https://weiserlab.github.io/ambuj/brf) As part of this research direction, we are developing an alternative to conventional and widely used wireless communication methods for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The growing scale of IoT devices motivates this direction, resulting in energy and spectrum challenges. This direction includes projects such as a system that uses; 1) visible light (LiFi) for communication to avoid the RF spectrum altogether. 2) Tunnel diode and backscatter transmitters use orders of magnitude less energy than commercial transmitters. 3) Using electronically steerable directional antennas in IoT devices to maximize spectrum efficiency. 

**Available positions:**  6X students fully supported for four years (3X in this admission round) (4X Years)

Following are examples of projects that can be pursued for doctoral studies:

### P3: Enabling Low-power communication for Internet of Things 

One of the important challenge to  rapid growth in IoT device numbers is their energy consumption. Batteries are an important part of the IoT devices. Most IoT devices today require battery replacement several times during their lifetime. This can be challenging due to IoT devices being deployed at enormous scale, and they are often located in hard-to-reach places. Among the different tasks performed by IoT device, communication is the most power consuming task. Thus, energy-intensive wireless transceivers are one of the primary reason for the high power consumption of IoT devices.

Using tunnel diode oscillators and backscatter mechanisms, we have developed very low-power transmitters for tackling the  challenge of energy expensive wireless transmission. In this project, we go beyond our previous efforts. To enhance the reliability of transmissions and receptions, we would look to use various spreading and coding mechanisms. Another pertinent issue we aim to address is the reception challenge. Low-power receivers today have limited capabilities, and they must catch up with the capabilities of low-power transmitters. In this project, we aim to go beyond current low-power receivers (envelope detectors).  Eventually, our goal is to design transceivers that can transmit and receive hundreds of meters at a few hundred kilobits while consuming less than 100 microwatts. Comparing this to commercial transceivers, this would be atleast an order of magnitude improvement. With this project, IoT devices would be capable of lasting their entire lives without replacing batteries, or even operating without batteries from energy harvested from the environment.

### P4: Hyperscale sensing via low-power, computation-less Internet of Things platforms 

Historically, communication has been considered the most power-consuming operation in IoT devices. Recently, some advances in designing low-power transmitters based on backscatter mechanisms (including some of our own) have overturned this notion. Computing becomes a more power-intensive task on IoT devices.

As part of our earlier research, we have explored alternative IoT device architectures that eliminate computational units to tackle the energy challenge of IoT devices. In this architecture, sensors are directly coupled to a low-power backscatter radio or tunnel diode transmitter (bypassing microcontrollers), thus enabling sensing and communication at microwatts of power. In this project, we build on these promising early results and aim to design sensors that perform very little or no computation. Instead, most of the processing tasks are delegated to edge devices. As part of this project, we will design a generic sensor platform. The next step is to explore how these sensors interact with edge devices and design associated infrastructure on edge devices. Finally, we would investigate scaling and supporting large numbers of these sensors and edge devices. These sensors could last a decade on a coin cell battery or only operate on harvested energy from the environment.
