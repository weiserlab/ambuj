# WEISER Group at National University of Singapore

We are a group of students, engineers, and researchers interested in wireless, embedded systems, intelligence, sensing, and emerging technologies (WEISER).  We build **REAL** systems and  commonly operate at the intersection of electronics, communication, and computer science. Hence, engineering systems is an important part of our activity. 

We are a wold-leading group with numerous awards, and group's scientific findings are consistently published at leading venues, such as ACM MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys, HotNets, HotMobile, and IPSN. We are well-funded, connected to other groups (like UC Berkeley via Lab 11), and corporations (such as NCS and previously with ABB). 

We would like to work with students and scholars with a strong engineering background with experience in one or more of the following areas:  

* Embedded systems (such as programming microcontrollers and FPGAs)
* Previous experience with interfacing sensors and actuators
* Wireless communication (such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee)
* Robot systems, drones, and associated system such as ROS operating systems
* Embedded systems platforms (such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino)
* Machine learning frameworks (such as PyTorch and Tensorflow)
* 3D Printing, PCB Design and assembly
* IC Design, fabrication of chips
* Wireless tesbeds, software defined radios
* Language models, and other such buzzwords!

We value curiosity, creativity, diligence, and a passion for engineering real-world systems, conducting experiments and motivation for learning.

## National University of Singapore 

The National University of Singapore is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world, with its computer science department being particularly well-regarded. However, it is important to approach rankings with a high degree of skepticism and to make a reasoned assessment of the best choice for your career. It is important to consider factors beyond just rankings when making decisions about your education and career.
