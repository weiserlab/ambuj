# TUTORIAL 5 for WEEK 8 (Starting 6th March 2023)


[1] **Question 1:** In the figure below, 3 cricket nodes are placed in a 2D square of 10m by 10m.  The wall clock time for the radio and audio signals, emitted by the node to be localized, to reach the 3 cricket nodes are shown in the table below.  You can assume that speed of light is 2x10^8 m/s and speed of sound is 300m/s. Also processing time is negligible. Your task is to estimate the location of the node to be localized giving the (x,y) coordinates in meters, using the position of cricket 1 as (0,0).
