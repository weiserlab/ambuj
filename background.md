# Biography

Ambuj Varshney, a Swedish citizen, is an Assistant Professor at the  National University of Singapore. Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) of the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). He was also a visiting researcher (three months) at the [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://kth.se). He completed his doctoral studies at [Uppsala University, Sweden](https://www.uu.se/en). As a PhD student, he was also closely associated with Swedish Institute of Computer Sciences (SICS) (Now called [RISE](http://ri.se)). And even before, he was a software engineer (firmware) at [NXP Semiconductors](https://www.nxp.com/). 

Ambuj Varshney’s interests have centered around embedded systems, wireless, and mobile computing for over a decade. He has tackled energy asymmetry among components of embedded systems, a pressing problem that hinders their widespread deployment. Varshney has designed novel low-power wireless transmitters that achieve hundreds of meters of range at tens of microwatts of power consumption—orders of magnitude lower than widely used commercial transmitters. His research has led to awards, accolades, grants, and an ABB Research Award in Honour of Hubertus von Gruenberg (with an endowment of 300,000 USD hosted at the University of California, Berkeley). His doctoral dissertation received this award in 2019. Several of his students have also received significant honors and accolades; for example, one student won the ACM Student Research Competition at ACM MobiCom 2017. Varshney has served as a jury member, program committee member, and organizer for several important scientific events.
