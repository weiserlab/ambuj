## Open Positions (6+ NOS)  

## P1: Internet of Things and Large Language Models (LLMs)  
([Jointly with NUS-NCS Research Lab](https://nus-ncs.nus.edu.sg/))

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard have garnered substantial interest and seen significant advancements in their capabilities. We are keenly interested in constructing "Eyes and Ears" for LLMs by interfacing sensors and actuators with these models. Additionally, we aim to explore other facets of integrating LLMs with Internet of Things devices. We have already achieved some very promising results in this regard.

This subproject is a component of a larger project where we are developing a comprehensive framework that melds sensors, edge devices, and LLMs for non-intrusive monitoring of the robots and IoT devices.

## P2: Low-Power Wireless Sensing of Vital Signs using Tunnel Diodes
[Funded through ARTIC@CDE, NUS]()

Every day, we engage with wireless signals. WiFi, as an example, connects our electronic devices to the internet. However, the use of wireless signals extends beyond communication. These signals, reflected or refracted by large objects in the environment, can provide additional information. For instance, signals bounced off our bodies may reveal details about our heart rate and respiratory patterns.

Our recent advancements have allowed us to generate wireless signals with a power consumption that is 1000 times less than that of smartphones or WiFi routers. Our preliminary and quite promising results suggest that this could pave the way for innovative sensing methods. For instance, we've demonstrated its potential use in detecting gestures via hand movements (MOBICOM 2022, Poster). As part of this project, our aim is to expand upon these promising results, designing a highly efficient, low-power system for monitoring heart and respiration rates. When juxtaposed with existing systems, our solution promises to be significantly less complex and considerably more power-efficient.

### P3: Enabling Low-power communication for Internet of Things 

A key challenge to the rapid proliferation of IoT devices is their substantial energy consumption. As most IoT devices necessitate frequent battery replacements throughout their lifespan, it becomes problematic due to their large-scale deployment and often inaccessible locations. Among various tasks, communication proves to be the most energy-intensive, with wireless transceivers accounting for most power consumption.

Addressing this, we've developed low-power transmitters utilizing tunnel diode oscillators and backscatter mechanisms, significantly reducing energy consumption. Now, our focus extends to bolstering transmission reliability with various spreading and coding mechanisms, and tackling the limitations of low-power receivers to match low-power transmitter capabilities.

The ultimate goal is to design transceivers capable of transmitting and receiving data across hundreds of meters at a few hundred kilobits, consuming under 100 microwatts - a significant improvement compared to commercial transceivers. This advancement could enable IoT devices to operate throughout their lifespan without battery replacements, or even run on energy harvested from the environment.

### P4: Computation-less Internet of Things platforms 

Historically, communication has been the most energy-intensive operation in IoT devices. However, recent innovations, including our own in low-power transmitter design using backscatter mechanisms, have shifted this power burden to computing.

Our previous research sought to address this by proposing IoT device architectures that eliminate computational units, thereby reducing energy consumption. In these models, sensors bypass microcontrollers to directly connect with low-power backscatter radios or tunnel diode transmitters, enabling energy-efficient sensing and communication.

Building on this, our current project aims to design sensors requiring minimal to no computation, delegating most processing tasks to edge devices. We plan to develop a versatile sensor platform, examine the interaction between sensors and edge devices, and design the necessary infrastructure. Ultimately, we aim to explore scalability and support for extensive sensor and edge device networks. This could allow sensors to operate for a decade on a single coin cell battery, or solely on harvested environmental energy.
