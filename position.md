# WEISER Group at National University of Singapore

We are a curiosity driven group of students, engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded systems and Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies (WEISER). We build real systems, and we commonly work at the intersection of the area of electronics, communication and computer science.  In addition to publishing scientific results at leading  venues in the area (such as ACM MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys, HotNets, IPSN), we have received several research awards, industry grants, and media coverage in leading publications across the world. 

We aim to establish a world-leading group in embedded systems, wireless communications, and mobile computing. Our group is looking to expand, so we are looking to hire ambitious students for the following positions:


## Open Positions (6 NOS)  

## Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Internet of Things Devices and Robots


## Low-power Vibration Monitoring


## Doctoral Disseration (PhD Studies) (Positions open in this round: 3 NOS)


## National University of Singapore and Singapore
