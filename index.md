I am an Assistant Professor at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg). 


I am bootstrapping the WEISER group, which consists of curious students, engineers and researchers who are interested in **W**ireless, **E**mbedded systems, **I**ntelligence, **S**ensing and **E**me**r**ging Technologies in **R**eal World **(WEISER)**. We are systems researchers who work at the intersection of electronics, communication and computer science. We tackle problems that have a strong engineering component and a potential for real-world impact.

## Biography

Ambuj Varshney, a Swedish citizen, is an Assistant Professor at the  National University of Singapore. Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the [Department of EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) of the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). He was also a visiting researcher (three months) at the [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://kth.se). He completed his doctoral studies at [Uppsala University, Sweden](https://www.uu.se/en). As a PhD student, he was also closely associated with Swedish Institute of Computer Sciences (SICS) (Now called [RISE](http://ri.se)). And even before, he was a software engineer (firmware) at [NXP Semiconductors](https://www.nxp.com/). 

Ambuj Varshney’s interests have centered around embedded systems, wireless, and mobile computing for over a decade. He has tackled energy asymmetry among components of embedded systems, a pressing problem that hinders their widespread deployment. Varshney has designed novel low-power wireless transmitters that achieve hundreds of meters of range at tens of microwatts of power consumption—orders of magnitude lower than widely used commercial transmitters. His research has led to awards, accolades, grants, and an ABB Research Award in Honour of Hubertus von Gruenberg (with an endowment of 300,000 USD hosted at the University of California, Berkeley). His doctoral dissertation received this award in 2019. Several of his students have also received significant honors and accolades; for example, one student won the ACM Student Research Competition at ACM MobiCom 2017. Varshney has served as a jury member, program committee member, and organizer for several important scientific events.

## Research Interest
Our vision is to seamlessly integrate digital and physical worlds, thus providing tools for exploring and better understanding our world and reality. In pursuit of our vision, we are focused on two directions: STICORS and BeyondRF.

[**STICORS:**](https://weiserlab.github.io/ambuj/stico) This research directions aims to develop a framework for general purpose, flexible form factor, and long-lasting computers. Unlike traditional sensor platforms, these computers will not just sense and transmit information. They will be able to sense the physical world, actuate the environment, interact with users, process, store, and infer information, and transmit wirelessly. Based on our previous systems, such as LoRea [(ACM SENSYS 2017)]() and Judo [(ACM MOBISYS 2022)](), these computers will be able to communicate over long distances.

[**BEYOND RF:**](https://weiserlab.github.io/ambuj/brf) We are developing alternative wireless communication methods for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The increasing number of IoT devices has led to challenges with energy and spectrum usage. To address these challenges, our projects focus on using; 1) visible light (LiFi) for communication to avoid using the RF spectrum altogether [(VLCS 2016)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2981548.2981559) [(VLCS 2017)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3129881.3129890) [(MOBICOM 2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3300061.3345451) [(MOBISYS 2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3386901.3388918) 2) Tunnel diode and backscatter transmitters that use orders of magnitude less energy than commercial transmitters [(MOBICOM 2019)]() [(MOBICOM 2020)]() [(MOBISYS 2022)](); Previously, we have also investigated, 3) Electronically steerable directional atennas in IoT devices for spectrum efficient communication and sensing [(IPSN 2015)]() [(SENSYS 2015)]()

My first computer was an IBM PC XT back in 1992. Since 1998, I have been a supporter of the free and open-source software movement and Linux. In 2000-2001, I contributed to the IndLinux project and translated many applications to Hindi. After finishing high school, I created and maintained a popular Linux blog that was ranked in the top 10 in its genre. I used the revenue from advertisements (Google Adsense)  to partially fund my undergraduate education.
