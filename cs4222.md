## OVERVIEW  
This course provides students with a foundation in the field of wireless networks and introduces them to the rapidly growing area of Internet-of-Things (IoT). The course covers wireless networking at all levels of the networking stack, including the physical, link, MAC, routing, and application layers. We will examine wireless standards, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee cellular networks, and long-range standards, such as LoRa. The course also covers emerging wireless technologies such as LiFi (light fidelity or visible light communication) and backscatter mechanisms. Throughout the course, a focus will be placed on IoT devices' energy efficiency and the integration of sensing, communication, and processing. Finally, the course emphasizes the practical application of these concepts through projects that allow students to create software prototypes on IoT devices.
