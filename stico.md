# STICORS: Framework for Large-Scale, Ubiquitous, Privacy-Preserving, Flexible Form-Factor, Everlasting Computers with a Very Long-Range Wireless Capability
![flexible form factor sensor](abbflexsensor.jpeg)  
We illustrate a proof-of-concept, flexible-form, wireless computer that can through reflection and absorption of ambient wireless signals (building on LoRea (ACM SENSYS 2017)) achieve significant transmission range.

## Project PI: Prof. Dr. Ambuj Varshney 

## Vision

The goal of this project is to develop a framework to manage large-scale deployments of flexible computers (STICORS) that are packed with sensors, processors, energy storage, and human-computer interaction mechanisms, and that can connect wirelessly over long distances. These computers will be able to handle a range of advanced computing and communication tasks. This framework has the potential to support a wide range of applications, but we are focusing on designing a platform for analytics on massive amounts of data collected (from physical world) using STICORS.

STICORS is a research project that requires expertise in multiple engineering fields, including electronics, communication, computer science, and materials science. At present, the goals of the STICORS project are not yet attainable and will require significant scientific advances, which are also the major focus of the STICORS project.

We are targetting following parameters for STICORS computers:

* **Bitrate:** Wireless communication link with bitrate of over 100 kbps (uplink and downlink)
* **Range:** Communication range of over 100 meters in a line-of-sight environment, but the range is limited to tens of meters in environments with obstructions (non line-of-sight)
* **Everlasting:** STICORS is designed for low power consumption through hardware and software optimizations, allowing the batteries to last for the entire deployment without replacement. In certain cases, STICORS may be able to function without batteries by utilizing energy harvested from ambient energy sources
* **Storage:** With support for hundreds of kilobytes of non-volatile memory, STICORS is able to store a vast amount of sensor and other information
* **Processing:** Ability to support complex computational and algorithmic tasks
* **Human Computer Interaction (HCI):** Interacting with users through novel low-power HCI mechanisms
