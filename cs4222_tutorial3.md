# TUTORIAL 3 for WEEK5 (Starting 6th of February 2023)


[1] **Question 1:** What sensors does your phone or wearable device (such as a Fitbit) use to estimate the number of steps you have taken? How does it perform step-counting? For one possible approach, you can read the reference paper:

* A.R. Jimenez, etal, “A comparison of pedestrian Dead-Reckoning Algorithms using a Low-Cost MEMS IMU,” WISP 2009. (Sections II and III)


[2] **Question 2:** Please list the sensor(s) you plan to use to support the following application scenarios. 

| Application scenario |
|-------|
| How can metallic objects be detected if they are buried in the soil? | 
| What is the sensor to detect blood oxygen levels on a wearable device?| 
| Determine the water level in a tank situated on top of a building? | 
| Generate a 3D mapping of historical structures? | 

[3] **Question 3:** Molex is a producer of [thin-film/flexible batteries](https://www.molex.com/molex/products/family/thinfilm_battery). These batteries are [rated](https://www.molex.com/webdocs/datasheets/pdf/en-us/0132990001_ACCESSORIES.pdf) with a capacity of 10 mAH/voltage of 3V. 

a. Please compute the battery lifespan when powering the following componenets of IoT devices solely (no other component is powered):

* [BME 280: Pressure, Humidity, Temperature Sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/#technical) (Sampling at 1Hz), current 3.6 microamperes
* [ADXL 337: Accelerometer](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL337.pdf), supply current 300 microamperes
* [OPT 101: Light sensor](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opt101.pdf), current 120 microamperes
* [HM01B01: Camera](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15570), current approx. 1500 microamperes

b. How would extend battery life to much longer duation that what you had calculated in Part 3(a). How does the characteristics of application help you make this decision?

[4] **Question 4:** TBA
