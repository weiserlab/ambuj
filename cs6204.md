## OVERVIEW  

Internet of things (IoT) is an integral part of our lives with millions of IoT devices deployed worldwide, and projected to reach a trillion within our lifetime.  

This course covers the basics of IoT systems and some of the emerging applications. A major focus of this course is on wireless networking, one of the most critical functions of an IoT device. This course covers various topics such as,  device architecture, basics of wireless communication and standards, emerging wireless standards, sensing and actuation, and power management. Other topics related to IoT are also discussed in invited lectures (by leading academic researchers and leaders from industry) as well as student driven seminars.  

## PREREQUISITES  

We expect this course will be most beneficial to students with a background in embedded systems, mobile computing, networking, sensing, and wireless communication. Regardless of your background, as long as you are willing to learn, you can participate and benefit from taking the course.  

## READINGS

This course is based on research papers related to IoT that are seminal to the area, or have appeared recently at leading venues for research related to IoT and mobile systems  such as ACM MobiCom, MobiSys, Sigcomm, NSDI, SenSys, IMWUT. Therefore, there is no recommended textbook for the course.  


## GRADING

Course is graded based on class participation, presentations, and projects. Although there is no expectation for publishable results at the end of the course, there may be bonus points awarded for ambitious and well executed projects.
