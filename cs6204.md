## Overview  

Internet of things (IoT) is an integral part of our lives with millions of IoT devices deployed worldwide, and projected to reach a trillion within our lifetime.  

This course covers the basics of IoT systems and some of the emerging applications. A major focus of this course is on wireless networking, one of the most critical functions of an IoT device. This course covers various topics related to IoT, including device architecture, wireless communication and standards, emerging wireless standards, sensing and actuation, and power management. Other topics  related topics are discussed in invited lectures as well as student driven seminars.  

## Prerequisites
This  is an advanced-level course, we expect this course would be most beneficial for students with a background in embedded systems, networking, sensing and wireless communication. However, even if you don't have a particular background, you can participate if you have a willingness to learn and strong programming/machine learning skills.

## Readings
The course will be based on research papers published by leading venues and researchers. During the course, we will provide a schedule and list of readings. Therefore, we do not recommend any particular textbook for the course.
