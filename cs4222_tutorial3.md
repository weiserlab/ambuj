# TUTORIAL 3 for WEEK5 (Starting 6th of February 2023)


[1] **Question 1:** What sensors does your phone or wearable device (such as a Fitbit) use to estimate the number of steps you have taken? How does it perform step-counting? For one possible approach, you can read the reference paper:

* A.R. Jimenez, etal, “A comparison of pedestrian Dead-Reckoning Algorithms using a Low-Cost MEMS IMU,” WISP 2009. (Sections II and III)


[2] **Question 2:** Please list the sensor(s) you plan to use to support the following application scenarios. 

| Application scenario |
|-------|
| Detecting metallic objects that are buried in the soil | 
| Detecting blood oxygen levels on a wearable device| 
| Determining water level in a tank situated on top of a building| 
| Generate a 3D mapping of historical structures | 

[3] **Question 3:** Molex is a producer of [thin-film/flexible batteries](https://www.molex.com/molex/products/family/thinfilm_battery). These batteries are [rated](https://www.molex.com/webdocs/datasheets/pdf/en-us/0132990001_ACCESSORIES.pdf) with a capacity of 10 mAH/voltage of 3V. 

a. Can you calculate the battery life when powering the following components of IoT devices exclusively (no other components are being powered)?

* [BME 280: Pressure, Humidity, Temperature Sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/#technical) (Sampling at 1Hz), current 3.6 microamperes
* [ADXL 337: Accelerometer](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL337.pdf), supply current 300 microamperes
* [OPT 101: Light sensor](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opt101.pdf), current 120 microamperes
* [HM01B01: Camera](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15570), current approx. 1500 microamperes

b. How can you extend the battery life to a much longer duration than what was calculated in Part 3(a)? How do the characteristics of the application assist in making this decision?
