# PROMPTS FOR CHATGPT

## OVERVIEW
Large language models (LLMs) like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) are trained on vast amounts of data, making them proficient in conversation and providing feedback. Despite a somewhat unsuccessful history, chatbots are finally reaching a point where they can be highly beneficial for learning. ChatGPT, for example, can be used to gain knowledge about wireless technology. We encourage the use of this tool for educational purposes in our course.

We encourage you to interact with ChatGPT by providing it with prompts related to wireless networking and technologies, and to engage in conversation with the bot in order to expand your knowledge on the subject. Below, you will find a list of sample prompts.


## Lecture 1

* Can you describe the early history of wireless communication?
* What is photophone and history of this device?
* What is early history of FM modulation technique?
* Describe some examples of everyday internet of things devices that we use
* What are challenges to massive growth of internet of things
* What is smartdust?
* Can you give examples of different sensors used in IoT devices?

## POLICY REGARDING USING AI TOOLS

We are experiencing a major shift in the computing landscape with the emergence of advanced tools such as Language Language Models (LLMs) such as [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). These tools are poised to have a significant impact on the field, and we are embracing this change by incorporating them into our course curriculum. The CS4222/5222 course will be one of the first (if not the first) course in the world at a major univeristy to actively use OpenAI's ChatGPT in teaching wireless technology. Students will be provided with "prompts" to work with the model and we may also propose projects for more ambitious students to utilize ChatGPT. However, we will not be using ChatGPT for tutorials in this iteration of the course. It is important for students who utilize ChatGPT to clearly indicate that they have employed the tool.

**IMPORTANT:** It is important to note that Large Language Models (LLMs) are still in the early stages of development and may not always produce accurate results. Therefore, these tools should only be used as a supplement, not as the primary source of information, and one should use them with caution.
