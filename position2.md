# Wireless, Embedded Systems, Intelligence, Sensing, and Emerging Technologies (WEISER) Group

We are a group of ambitious students, engineers, and researchers focused on building real-world systems at the intersection of electronics, communication, and computer science.  Our group is a leader in the field of mobile computing and embedded systems, recognized with several awards. We consistently publish our scientific findings in flagship venues of the area, like ACM MobiSys, MobiCom, SenSys, HotNets, HotMobile, and IPSN. We are well-funded and connected with other  groups, including UC Berkeley’s Lab 11, and with companies like NCS in Singapore and previously with ABB through 2019 ABB Research Award in Honor of Hubertus von Grünberg. 

We would like to work with scholars with interests in following areas:  

* Embedded systems (such as programming microcontrollers and FPGAs)
* Previous experience with interfacing sensors and actuators
* Wireless communication (such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee)
* Robot systems, drones, and associated system such as ROS operating systems
* Embedded systems platforms (such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino)
* Machine learning frameworks (such as PyTorch and Tensorflow)
* 3D Printing, PCB Design and assembly
* IC Design, fabrication of chips
* Wireless tesbeds, software defined radios
* Language models, and other such buzzwords!

We value curiosity, creativity, diligence, and a passion for engineering real-world systems. 


### Research Fellow (1X)

We are seeking scholars who are approaching the end of their PhD studies or are in the initial phase of a postdoctoral fellowship at another institution. We welcome ambitious individuals willing to commit to a 12-18 month tenure with us, aiming for a future in academia or research labs. Ideal candidates will have demonstrated excellence through peer-reviewed publications and recognitions at leading research venues in our area of expertise (SIGCOMM, MobiCom, NSDI, IMWUT, SenSys, IPSN, HotMobile).


### Research Assistant (1X)

We are seeking research assistants who are enthusiastic about working on low-power sensing problems using embedded platforms. Additionally, we are interested in hiring students who are keen on working with robots and language models. 


### Visiting Interns (10X)

We welcome  students who would like to visit us. We prioritize students who would like to intern for at least six months and  are serious about   pursuing research as one of their career paths.
