## Overview  

Internet of things (IoT) is an integral part of our lives with millions of IoT devices deployed worldwide, and projected to reach a trillion in the near future.  


## Approach
A weekly lecture will be held for√ü the course (every Wednesday). Presentations by students are an essential part of the evaluation criteria and course. It is expected that these presentations would cover seminal research from the area and exciting results from seminal conferences (ACM SENSYS, MOBICOM, MOBISYS, NSDI, SIGCOMM). We may also invite and organize talks from industry and leading academic researchers, depending on the class size.

## Prerequisites
This  is an advanced-level course, we expect this course would be most beneficial for students with a background in embedded systems, networking, sensing and wireless communication. However, even if you don't have a particular background, you can participate if you have a willingness to learn and strong programming/machine learning skills.

## Readings
The course will be based on research papers published by leading venues and researchers. During the course, we will provide a schedule and list of readings. Therefore, we do not recommend any particular textbook for the course.
