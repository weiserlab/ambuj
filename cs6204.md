## Overview  

With hundreds of millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed worldwide, and the number of IoT devices projected to reach a trillion in the near future; we find that IoT has become a crucial part of our lives. Among the various tasks performed by IoT devices, wireless networking is one of the most critical tasks. This particular task has also dictated most of the research effort within the over the past two decades. This course will cover a broad spectrum of topics related to wireless communication, sensing and the networking aspect of IoT devices. The topics we intend to cover during the semester includes; Fundamentals of the internet of things, commonly employed wireless standards, energy challenge of IoT devices, sustainability and recent thrust towards battery-free operations, and emerging transmission mechanisms backscatter communication and visible light communication (LiFi).

## Approach
A weekly lecture will be held for the course (every Wednesday). Presentations by students are an essential part of the evaluation criteria and course. It is expected that these presentations would cover seminal research from the area and exciting results from seminal conferences (ACM SENSYS, MOBICOM, MOBISYS, NSDI, SIGCOMM). We may also invite and organize talks from industry and leading academic researchers, depending on the class size.

## Prerequisites
This  is an advanced-level course, we expect this course would be most beneficial for students with a background in embedded systems, networking, sensing and wireless communication. However, even if you don't have a particular background, you can participate if you have a willingness to learn and strong programming/machine learning skills.

## Readings
The course will be based on research papers published by leading venues and researchers. During the course, we will provide a schedule and list of readings. Therefore, we do not recommend any particular textbook for the course.
